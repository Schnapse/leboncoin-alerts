# Leboncoin Alerts

## Introduction

It's a small script I used when I was looking for a new appartment. At the moment, it's only working for retrieving appartements/houses for rent. 

## Automating

You can automate your alerts with a simple CRON task. Just create a bash file executing the file `main.rb` and register a CRON task which will execute your bash script.
